Hi all, I’m a Staff Software Engineer currently working on FinTech and stablecoin infrastructure at [Figure Technologies](https://figuremarkets.com). I joined the company when it was one year old, and helped it scale to a successful IPO in September 2025. Before that I worked for Blackmore Sensors and Analytics (now part of [Aurora](https://aurora.tech)), and Los Alamos National Laboratory.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Montana State University](https://www.montana.edu/) and a Master’s degree in Computer Science from [Montana State University](https://www.montana.edu/). During my studies, I developed a strong interest in algorithms, programming languages, simulation, machine learning, and cryptography. I completed my Master’s thesis on [applying convolutional neural networks to hyper-spectral imagery](/documents/Senecal_Thesis.pdf). I continue to develop these interests through side projects, including implementations of [encrypted chat over a decentralized bluetooth mesh](https://github.com/senecal-jjs/bitchat-client-react-native) and work on challenges like [CryptoPals](https://github.com/senecal-jjs/crypto-pals).

Outside of work, I enjoy cycling (gravel, mountain), and trail running. I'm a track and field coach at a high school in my town, where I've helped kids find a joy for the sport. We've had some success as well with recent state titles. I also [read](/library) quite often, and I like keeping track of titles I've enjoyed.
