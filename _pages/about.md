I am a Master's student in the Numerical Intelligent Systems Lab at Montana
State, where we focus on applying machine learning, mathematics, and
software engineering to solve a variety of problems.

My interests are wide ranging, but I particularly enjoy working
with cyber-physical systems, and data intensive projects. In the past
I have worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where I applied computational
techniques to monitor the health of a variety of structures. I also spent
time working in the computational fluid dynamics field developing new algorithms
and visualizations. 

My research is focused on creating a technology to assess the health of large volumes of fruits
and vegetables using a combination of hyper-spectral imaging and machine learning. I am also 
currently an intern at Blackmore Sensors & Analytics, where I am developing tools to analyze LiDAR data.
